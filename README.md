# HW-Responsive-Portfolio
Responsive Portfolio

#This project displays 3 htmls, which follow a responsive design using columns and rows with CSS to fit a desired design.

#It displays visually how objects are aligned in a website given the proper commands. As well as it is great practice with using navs, images, positioning sections, making responsive sections and adapting the pages behavior acorrdingly. 

#To install or try out the project users need a brower and open up the html.

#Users can get further help in w3shcools or MDN or stockoverflow.

#I, Roberto Baldizon mantain and contribute to the project, the files used to create this are previous ones used in other assignment, as well as others provided by class staff.

#Technologies used HTML & CSS + Responsive Design.
